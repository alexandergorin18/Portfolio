    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="bio">
      I’m an aerospace engineering student at UCLA with a strong interest in defense, robotics, and propulsion systems. I'm passionate about solving complex engineering problems and applying technology to real-world challenges.
    </p>
    <h3 class="project-heading">Courses Taken</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Statics and Strength of Materials, Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies, Fluid Mechanics, Material Science, Thermodynamics, Transport Phenomena, Electrical and Electronic Circuits
</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Projects & Experience</h2>
    <h3 class="project-heading">Part-Time Internship at Advanced Manufacturing Company of America</h3>
    <p>
      Hired by an early-stage aerospace component startup with $76.5 million in funding to create 3D models of mechanical components with incomplete design documentation.
      Analyzed available top-level drawings, work instructions, and bill of materials to reconstruct missing details.
      Translated technical documents from Spanish, identified missing specifications, modeled components in CAD, and iterated based on additional data.
      Successfully developed accurate 3D models and assembly files, ensuring proper fitment and alignment with design requirements.

    <h3 class="project-heading">UCLA Mobility Lab</h3>
    <p>
      Introductory project to join the lab. Successfully annotated two vehicles, frame by frame for 140–150 frames.
      Carefully labeled key features, including pedestrians, cars, trucks, and other road entities to support machine learning models for autonomous driving.

  We are currently working on creating detailed vector maps in MathWorks RoadRunner using PCD-format LiDAR data collected from a UCLA-monitored intersection, capturing lane markings, curbs, and road geometry to support simulation and perception tasks.
      Next step: Exporting vector maps into Unreal Engine using CARLA to test autonomous driving performance in simulated environments.</p>

<h3 class="project-heading">UCLA Robotics and Mechatronics Lab</h3>
    <p>
      I just joined this lab in the summer of 2025 and will be working on the drone project.
    </p>

    <h3 class="project-heading">Engineering 1: Rockets Class</h3>
    <h4>Project 1: GDPR</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed iterative CAD model with ±0.010" tolerances for precision fit</li>
      <li>Integrated parachute system, bulkhead motor retention, and shock cord mounts</li>
      <li>Optimized for 8”x8”x8” print volume with minimal supports and 20% infill</li>
      <li>Designed for functional performance and ease of 3D printing</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Project 2: G-Class High-Powered Rocket</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Led the end-to-end design and construction of a G-class high-powered rocket in a 4-person team, with the objective of reaching a precise 3,000 ft apogee while safely carrying a raw egg and avionics payload.</li>
      <li>Conducted CAD modeling, OpenRocket simulations, and material selection to meet rigorous flight requirements including off-the-rail speed ≥75 ft/s and stability range between 1.5 and 2.5.</li>
      <li>Manufactured and assembled key components such as fiberglass layup body tubes, bulkheads, and fin tab slots using 3D printing, laser cutting, and epoxy bonding techniques, ensuring tight tolerances for structural integrity.</li>
      <li>Achieved successful flight and payload recovery, meeting apogee within ±500 ft of the target and scoring top marks in design review, innovation, and build quality.</li>
    </ul>
